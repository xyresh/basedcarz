    <h2>The Ford Escort Cosworth Mk1</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="img/cossie.jpg">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The Ford Escort was ford's most popular European Car built in Essex</p>
    <p>The regular Escort was a run of the mill grocery getter.</p>
    <p>But soon it was realised that this car had a lot of potential with Ford's partnership</p>
    <p>with the race engine manufacturer Cosworth.Cosworth originally Built the DFV for Formula 1 racing for the lotus team.</p>
    <p>But the potential was realized very quickly to get a team of cosworth engineers to come up with a performance engine for the Escort.</p>
    <p>The answer Was the famous 1.6L BDA engine. A 4 Cylinder NA Twincam engine. for the late 60's A twincam engine was only ever seen in Racing!</p>
    <p>The engine Revved up to 9000RPM and produced a crazy 120+ HP thanks to a bore of 81mm and stroke of 77mm making it an oversquared design! </p>
    <p>Fed air through 2 double barrell Weber Carbs essentially making it a ITB engine and having Belt driven Cams made it really unique and interesting</p>
    <p>The combination of great chassis design by ford and this legendary engine gave this car multiple Rally wins Most notably the 1970 London to Mexico Rally.</p>
    <p>It is quite Clear that this car was Legendary in it's time and enthusiasts of british Cars have this car on a pedestal.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>>it's really Lightweight, weighing in at about 800 kg's!!!</h5>
    <h5>>it is a 60's car so everything is "dirt" simple (lel funny because it's a rally car lol)</h5>
    <h5>>very good chassis and very good handling as a result</h5>
    <h5>>Carbed engine which is quite a treat </h5>
    <h5>>well balanced rally car</h5>
    <h5>>it has a Cosworth engine in it that is a based enough reason to make it based!</h5>
    <h5>>that cossie engine, it's just amazing</h5>
    <h5>>If an EMP occurs it'll still run because it has no computer shite</h5>
    <br>
    <h3>So why not give the AE86 a go??</h3>
    <p>Most enthusiasts have gotten the good ones and the ones that remain probably don't run and if they do they need lot's of work and are probably extremely rusty</p>
    <p>The examples you will find have got the Legend tax on them meaning they'll cost you a pretty penny</p>
