    <br>
    <p>The Toyota Altezza, also sold under the lexus brand as the Lexus brand as the IS-200</p>
    <p>is a descent saloon powered by either the 3S-GE a successor to the legendary 4A-GE or the legendary 2JZ</p>
    <p>which can be found in the Toyota Supra</p>
    <p>This Car is very popular amongst the Drifting community.<p>
    <p>It's Power is impressive considering it's market appeal and was never intended to be a sporty car</p>
    <p>but it's FR layout is what gave it it's sporty appeal.<p>

    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>>it is reasonably light at 1200-ish kg's<h5>
    <h5>>it was made in an era where gadgets where only starting to become popular therefore is rather conservative with the gadgets</h5>
    <h5>>it is an enjoyable driving and it handles very well despite it's heavy weight</h5>
    <h5>>Thanks to RWD it can drift!!!</h5>
    <h5>>it's a Toyota thus can be maintained cheaply and can be run reasonably unless your a complete and utter maniac</h5>
    <h5>>can be had used for little money used</h5>
    <h5>you can flex you have a supra engine in it <h5>
    <br>
    <h3>So why not give this car a go??</h3>
    <p>it is heavier than many other BASED cars we have discussed on this site</p>
    <p>has a few gizmos that personally deter me from considering this car</p>
