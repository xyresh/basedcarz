    <h2>The Toyota/Subaru GR/GT86 / BRZ</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="img/GR86.jpg" width="640" height="360">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This Car is the spiritual successor to the might AE86.</p>
    <p>Co-developed by Subaru and Toyota this car is the best car one can get new</p>
    <p>to experience a well balanced car with little power.</p>
    <p>equiped with the 4U or FA boxer 4 engine which subaru is famous for designing</p>
    <p>paired with a very light Chassis developed by toyota and subaru makes this car ideal for touge driving</p>
    <p>,drifting and track days as much as sunday drives around twisties</p>
    <p>it may not have much power, and my not have the most interesting engine but cannot be underestimated as an option</p>
    <p>in regards to the power shortage the supercharging option is a good one as it maintains the throttle response and doesn't add turbo-esc</p>
    <p>characteristics such as bad turbo lag and etc. and saves you the complexity of a turbo. but i must say the stock power is plenty for most.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A new version of these two cars will be soon available with even more power and updated looks.</p>
    <p>Hopefully it's amazing handling characteristics will not be ruined</p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>>it's rather Leightweight, with a curb weight of 2700lbs or 1250kg's <h5>
    <h5>>it is a no nonsence car lacking many "MoDeRn" features and useless gizmos</h5>
    <h5>>it provides the ultimate driving experience , mostly</h5>
    <h5>>is well balanced with good weight distribution and handles great!</h5>
    <h5>>uses standardized parts therefore making it cheap to run and maintain and fix yourself!</h5>
    <h5>>can be had NEW for $26000</h5>
    <br>
    <h3>So why not give this car a go??</h3>
    <p>it's lack of power may deter many enthusiasts and can become boring on long and straight roads and tracks</p>
    <p>it's newer itterations have started to adopt SOY-Gineering gizmos and infotainment systems</p>
