        The E30 M3 , A car So based that it is seen anywhere, Rally, GT racing and even Drifting!!!
        Powered by a m20 4cylinder engine that produces around 200 horsepower.
        with a RWD and front engine configuration this car is quite a based vehicle.
        being the first M badged car by bmw this is quite a significant car in the lineup of BMW 
        <br>
        <br>
        this car earned the reputation as the best car bmw ever made.
        and i could arguably say that this statement is very true.
        after this model the cars produced were rather boring,complicated or a combination fo both..
