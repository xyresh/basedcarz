    The classic mini, one of the most influential if not the most influential car of the 20th century.
    it was originally designed by Sir Alec Issigonis, it was and remains very revolutionary.
    It was dirt cheap to produce and it's FWD subframe design was infact the very first, unlike nowadays where most cars
    have this exact design principle.
    <br>
    The fwd allowed the cabin to be much more spacious and accomondate many passengers.
    <br>
    The first version of it was equiped with a 1L SOHC, built by Austin Producing about 40 horsepower, but this wasn't the case
    For it's rally spec brother which was producing an earth shattering 60hp !!!!
    Later models especially in the 90's where equiped with the rover derived 1.3L which was infact a fuel injected engine.
    <br>
    This cars success in rally is very impressive especially in the 60's, where it's carzy short wheelbase and insanely low weight, with FWD(which is rare for a car in that era) it conquered snowy and gravel conditions, while at a slow pace due to the power deficit
    faster than it's competition, giving it an edge in snowy stages like monte carlo!
