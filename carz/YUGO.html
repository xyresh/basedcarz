        Ah yes, The Yugo, yugo but your car doesn't. yugo nowhere with it.

        unfortunately the yugo has earned a reputation as the worst car ever made, but that is not based on any reason.

        this car was actually quite well designed but the build quality and the materials put into it were sub par

        pair that with a anemic at best 1.3L carbeurated FIAT engine made this car very very bad to drive

        then if this car was so badly built why is it here??

        well it fits many of the BASED criteria and plus that it is not only sub zero it's sub absolute zero on the top gear board
