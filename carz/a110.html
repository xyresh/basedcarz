        The Alpine a110, the answer to the car enthusiast missing out on a light, small sportscar!
        Renault has revived the classic alpine brand and they've given us the a110, a tribute to the original a110
        from the 60's.
        <br>
        The modern itteration of the classic is fairly close and the car stunning to look at.
        powered by a 1.8L 4 cylinder turbo which produces about 250hp courtesy of renault.
        Paired with a superbly stiff and light chassis this car reimagines what has been lost over the years.
        the focus was on handling and the driving experience and absolutely not Power and straight line speed.
        <br>
        The mid engine RWD layout certainly adds to the experience of driving this car, therefore understeer will be rare
        and oversteer,is there in a more "safe" manner, especially since its got all the modern gizmos
        such as an LSD and various driver aids.
        unfortunately the car is only offered with a 7 speed DCT which is a mark down for a car getting many things right.
