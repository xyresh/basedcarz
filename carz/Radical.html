        The Radical SR-8
        <br>
        Allthough this is essentially a race car, it can still receive numberplates and be used on the road.
        It is one of the best track weapons you can buy and it is one of a kind.
        <br>
        The car weighs 680kgs! and that's thanks to carbon fiber being used everywhere on it.
        Powered by a 2.7L N/A V8, which is a frankenstein twin <a href="../moto/busa.html">hayabusa</a> engine,
        with about 400hp and 300lb ft of , this car is a monster.
        paired with sophisticated double wishbone suspension and slick tyres it handles better than anything on the road.
        to add salt to the equation this car is fitted with proper aerodynamics!
        <br>
        The engine is paired with a racing spec 6 speed Sequential meaning it still has a clutch for stopping and starting, but its not necessary
        for upshifts and downshifts.
        <br>
        this Car held the all time fastest record around the nordschleife from 2009 till 2010.
