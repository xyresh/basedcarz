    <h2>The MG metro 6R4</h2>

    The MG metro itself was quite an unassuming car when it launched in britain under the Austin Brand.
    Equiped with a 4 cylinder 1 L engine the metro was really slow and in general terms didn't do much perfectly.
    <br>
    In the meantime The WRC had introduced a new Category, Th group B, this is where legends were seen(both in terms of drivers and cars)!
    The metro competed in it's rally form against the Audi S1 quattro  lancia delta etc.
    you may say now how did it compete with such a crappy chassis and such an anemic engine when everyone was racing turbo engines pushing toward 400bhp!
    well the metro we saw in the wrc (and ofc the homologation specials) was only similar to the normal metro because of the name and body shape, everything else
    was completely different.
    <br>
    The engine found in this car was a A modular V6 derived from the mighty cosworth DFV platform which produced 410bhp!!@ 10000ish RPM!
    It was mounted behind the drivers going through a 5-speed gearbox into a central diff that spread torque 33% in the front front and 67% AFT.
    the result was supreme weight balance and a centre of mass which allowed the car to take jumps much more aggressively than the audi since it would remain stable during flight(if we could use this word!!)
    <br>
    So why did it fail?
    well it failed because racing is unpredictable especially rally, as demonstrated by lancia and audi..

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>it is a homologation special</h5>
            <h5>>A DFV Derived engine!!</h5>
            <h5>>A group b rally car!!</h5>
            <h5>>excellent weight distribution</h5>
            <h5>>brilliant suspension</h5>
            <h5>>was only made in RHD which is comfy for us irish/britfags</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
            <br>
    <h3>So why not give it a go??</h3>
    <p>You wont find one....</p>
    <p>good luck rebuilding a DFV in 2000+ there's no parts anywhere so everything will have to be fabricated.which is expensive AF</p>
    <h3>Overall BASED!</h3>
