        I'll take the liberty to say that if a god exists, and he made a car it would be this one.
        It is in my opinion the greatest car ever made.But many of you may ask, why?
        <br>
        The answer is simple, just the engine alone in this car makes it this good.
        let's see what's so special about it.
        it is a front-mid rear wheel drive sports car, it was never intended to be the fastest or the fanciest car.
        but what it is , is the brainchild of when you allow engineers who love cars to build what they actually want.
        It was built by lexus in order to establish themselves in the market as a high tier "luxury" and fun brand.
        The Chassis is a carbon monocoque with aluminium subframes in the front and aft.
        The Engine fitted to this car was the legendary 1LR-GUE, a 4.8L 72 degree V10, which produced 560hp at a fuel cut off 9500RPM (i'm sure it certainly could rev higher due to its high revving nature).
        Other notable features where the fact it was fitted with a dry sump oil system which is only really found in Race cars and the head was designed like the 4age by yamaha.
        The exhaust tune was tuned by yamaha's Musical instrument department(out of all departments) and boy does it sound like a musical instument.
        it is in my opinion and many others the best sound ever made by any production car.
        <br>
        So let's Take a listen to the roar of the angels
        </p>

        The 1LR-GUE:

        <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 600px; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
        So i have to admit this car is my all time favourite car and it is quite special to me, 
        unfortunately people like greta thundberg has killed amazing cars like this because of "climate change"
        when they don't care about it whatsoever, when they use they're iphone and travel by private jet to all these stupid climate conferences
        <br>
        so unfortunately we will most likely not get another car like this ever again in the future.
