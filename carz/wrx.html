The Subaru Impreza WRX STI<br>
A car Built For Rallying and rallying Only<br>
The STI is a 4wd sedan/coupe car, sporting a 4 cylinder boxer engine with a mad turbo, it pushes around 300 hp, paired to a 6 speed manual and a pretty nifty 4wd system.
the STI's were driven in rallying by some of the most legendary drivers such as the might collin mcrae among others.
in total subaru won 6 WRC championships and 46 rallies with the impreza platform and for good reason.
<br>
The Boxer 4 engine's shape allowed for it to be mounted much lower than traditional V or inline configurations, keeping the centre of mass
very low and helping with the overall balance of the car.
paired with fairly beefy suspension and the awesome 4wd system this car was a grip monster offroad.
