    <h2>The Mercedes 190 (W201)</h2>

        I know what you are all saying:"HoW cAn MeRcEdEs Be BaSeD", well back then they were. This masterpiece of engineering was available with a Cosworth engine, an AMG engine

        and simpler Daimler diesel and petrol engines(they even made aroung 200 electric examples). The lovechild between Daimler and Cosworth was the 190 Evo I and later the Evo II

        Bred to race DTM and to demolish the famous BMW M3 E30 of the era, the Evo II is now seen as one of the most successful racecars of all time. No one thought that  

        an entry level Mercedes could be competitive around the track but oh boy it was. It really was the same story as we see today in F1 (won 16/24 races of the season)

        Luxury was not in the minds of the lead enginers. While yes the car had an optional 4-speed auto, no one bought it. The car was also ridiculously reliable and cheap to run.

        You can still find them be driven around as dailys

    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>it is a homologation special</h5>
            <h5>>there even was a carbeurated engine</h5>
            <h5>>4/5 seats means you can take all the boys around the track at once</h5>
            <h5>>dead easy to mod/tune</h5>
            <h5>>it has legendary status in racing</h5>
            <h5>>no need to talk about the driving IT'S A RACECAR</h5>
            <h5>>the diesels will run forever<h5>
            <h5>>THE COOLEST WANG EVER</h5>
            <h5>>one guy even got former DTM racer and put a Judd V8 in it and started racing it in hillclimbs</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
            <br>
    <h3>So why not give it a go??</h3>
    <p>the "lesser" versions are nothing to write home about but they have potential</p>
    <p>the fast ones are really hard to find and cost more than a modern S63, I mean there are around 600 of them around</p>
    <h3>Overall BASED!</h3>
