        The Toyota MR-2, quite a Popular Sports car during it's production and has quite the reputation..

        The first version of the MR-2 came with the legendary 4A-GE, which is the ideal Engine for such a car

        Mounted Transversally Behind the driver it is a RWD mid engined Car. Quite unusual for a cheap Sport's car

        This allowed it to be used alot for Replicas and Fakes of Supercars.

        also it gained the nickname as a DeathTrap... which for the Early models was kind of justified due to

        The Lack of basic Safety features and often was in the hands of inexperienced reckless and incompetent drivers.

        which Explains the high crash Rate of it. nonetheless this car is the Supercar Formula at a lower price with less power.

        So it really has alot of potential regardless...
