        The Toyota Supra, one of the most infamous "JDM" cars in the car communiy.

        Allthough it may not produce 1000hp stock the 2jz engine is a solid platform for good power under boost

        it is well known that under lower boost and stress it can last for a very very long time and it makes total sense

        After All it is a cast iron block that weighs more than a black hole.The material itself has been put in place

        in order to reinforce the block and allow it to withstand really really high pressures thus allowing this engine to survive under 5 BAR of boost

        Asside for this engine being an utter beast the chassis itself is very well designed and very well balanced as a GRAND TOURING car, unlike the normies

        who say it is a "SpOrT's CaR", this car unfortunately is too big, and heavy to be considered a sports car thus we shall treat it as a GT car and not a sports car
