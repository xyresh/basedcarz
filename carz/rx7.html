        The RX7, a cult classic!
        <br>
        this Car has been considered one of the very best cars to come out of Japan and for good reason.
        The rx7 is unconventional just like many japaneese cars of its era, mainly it's engine is the reason, but there's
        more to it than just it's engine!
        <br>
        Equipped with a twin rotor, twin Turbo rotary engine, which produced 280HP as per the gentlemans
        agreement, the lightweight chassis weighing overall in at 1200kg's, this car was monsttously fast.
        paired with a 5 speed manual transmission that powered the rear wheels, this car is as fun as it gets
        to drive on mountainous "touge" road.
        <br>
        This car was built in an era directly after the tremendous success of the 787B at le mans, and pushed mazda's
        technology to the forefront of performance cars.

    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>it is lightweight at 1200kg's<h5>
            <h5>>simplistic 90's equipment</h5>
            <h5>>excellent driving dynamics</h5>
            <h5>>ROTARY ENGINE!!! </h5>
            <h5>>looks fantastic</h5>
            <h5>>pop up headlights<h5>
            <h5>>spits flames</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
    <h3>So why not give this car a go??</h3>
    <p>ROTARY ENGINE, meaning bad petrol mileage, Apex seal failures, constant engine rebuilds and endless frustration(totally worth it)</p>
    <p>will be tricky to find a good example at a price that isn't outrageous</p>
