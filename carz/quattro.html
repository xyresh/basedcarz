<br>
The Audi Quattro S1.<br>
the quattro was Audi's first awd road car, although audi had experimented with
awd on military vehicles for the german military, this was someting new for the
era it was built in.<br>
Equipped With the rare 20V 5 cylinder and a MASSIVE turbo, pushing about 200hp on road going versions and closer to 500! in rally trim.<br>
The quattro was clearly a scary car to drive back in the day, considering it had absolutely no driver aids such as ABS, TCS or Torque vectoring on the 2 diffs to make offroad and even road driving more manageable.Add to insult the fact the Turbo suffered from massive lag giving all its power way past 4.5K RPM.
It was Fairly Lightweight, but unfortunately very front heavy meaning it understeered alot and the balance was all over the place.
<br>
Nonetheless, the audi was very succesfull in the infamous Group B rally category, and nearly Won Michelle mouton her first WRC championship.
