        Peugeot is one of the more based manufacturers, they have been in the business for a while and overall are a favourite for myself.
        The 207RC , is a Hot hatch sporting a 1.6L 4 cylinder engine which was offered as a turbo aswell, providing us with 120 ish horsepower(NA) which is adequate.
        and 150hp for the turbo. Power is obviously not much of a concern though, especially since the car weighs in at about 1200 kilos wet. so its decently nimble and keeping the
        short wheelbase in mind can provide for a thrilling driving experience.
        <br>
        YES, this car has excellent driving dynamics, the steering is super light yet accurate, and best of all the non turbo has EXCELLENT throttle response which is something
        many manufacturers ignore, yet a responsive engine can make or brake the driving experience.
        Adding to the mix a stiff chassis, excellent suspension geometry and you get a car in which is heaps fun, and i would know, since i've driven it
        (thanks merc admin)!
        other cool features include the freakish styling of the mid 2000's, simplistic interior without many gizmos and bloat, its as straightforward as it gets.
        it is obvious why this was an excellent rally car.

    <h3>So why not give this car a go??</h3>
    <p>freaky styling, which is wonky and querky in a not so good way, although many of you may find it good looking(its really up to personal taste)</p>
