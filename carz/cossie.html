        The Ford Escort was ford's most popular European Car built in Essex

        The regular Escort was a run of the mill grocery getter.

        But soon it was realised that this car had a lot of potential with Ford's partnership

        with the race engine manufacturer Cosworth.Cosworth originally Built the DFV for Formula 1 racing for the lotus team.

        But the potential was realized very quickly to get a team of cosworth engineers to come up with a performance engine for the Escort.

        The answer Was the famous 1.6L BDA engine. A 4 Cylinder NA Twincam engine. for the late 60's A twincam engine was only ever seen in Racing!

        The engine Revved up to 9000RPM and produced a crazy 120+ HP thanks to a bore of 81mm and stroke of 77mm making it an oversquared design!

        Fed air through 2 double barrell Weber Carbs essentially making it a ITB engine and having Belt driven Cams made it really unique and interesting

        The combination of great chassis design by ford and this legendary engine gave this car multiple Rally wins Most notably the 1970 London to Mexico Rally.

        It is quite Clear that this car was Legendary in it's time and enthusiasts of british Cars have this car on a pedestal.

    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>

        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>it's really Lightweight, weighing in at about 800 kg's!!!</h5>
            <h5>>it is a 60's car so everything is "dirt" simple (lel funny because it's a rally car lol)</h5>
            <h5>>very good chassis and very good handling as a result</h5>
            <h5>>Carbed engine which is quite a treat </h5>
            <h5>>well balanced rally car</h5>
            <h5>>it has a Cosworth engine in it that is a based enough reason to make it based!</h5>
            <h5>>that cossie engine, it's just amazing</h5>
            <h5>>If an EMP occurs it'll still run because it has no computer shite</h5>
        </div>

    <br>
    <h3>So why not give the Cossie a go??</h3>
    <p>Most enthusiasts have gotten the good ones and the ones that remain probably don't run and if they do they need lot's of work and are probably extremely rusty</p>
    <p>The examples you will find have got the Legend tax on them meaning they'll cost you a pretty penny</p>
