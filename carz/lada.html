    <h2>The Fiat 124/Lada VAZ</h2>

    <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 600px; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
		The original car was the fiat 124, developed and built by fiat in the late 60's, was a small family sedan car.
		it was equipped with a variety of quite literally bulletproof engines, ranging from 1.2L i4 to 1.8!!!
		<br>	
		Fiat later made a deal with the soviet state owned company lada to build them under the lada VAZ badge for the soviet and broad east block market(wasn't exactly a market cause communism lol).
		The VAZ was so widespread(as it was one of the only cars you could get in the eastern block) that it is just known as "The Lada".
		<br>
		The car is characterized as being braindead simple in design, meaning it was extremely serviceable when stuff went wrong.
		you could literally fire a rifle at it and it would, start, run and EVEN move under its own power.
		Other luxuries beyond moving you from point a to b, were such luxurious features such as a radio!!! and if you were bery lucky an ASHTRAY!!!!!!
		<br>
		so it is quite obvious this car was super super barebones even for it's time.

    <h3>So even though its so basic, why has it created itself a cult following?</h3>
	<h3>And more importantly why is it so based??</h3>
