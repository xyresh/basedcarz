		  Back in the mid 20th century, the British were leading in the motorcycle industry, companies like triumph,Norton, BSA and many others were building the
		  Most Technically advanced bikes for the time, most of which had surpassed the 100mph barrier in terms of top speed.
		  One Company however was arguably further ahead of the competition, This was Vincent H.R.D motorcycles, with their C series of bikes(the black shadow and the black lightning).
          <br>
		  These bikes were some of the first to feature a single shock rear swingarm, and its fairly unique front "Girdraulic" Front forks.
		  The black Shadow specifically, equiped with a 998cc 50Â° V-Twin engine which produced Around 55hp was able to achieve a top speed of 125mph and has Also alegedly achieved an even higher speed
		  of 150mph, which is quite impressive considering that at the time, they only had a 4-speed gearbox!
		  <br>
		  Another unique and innovative Part of the bike was that the engine itself was a stress member, meaning it was part of the frame in terms of providing rigidity.
		  with this design vincent was able to reduce the overall weight of the bike even further.
		  And yes, all these features existed in the LATE 1940's!!!
