        <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 600px; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
          The CBX 1000 was honda's Flagship "Superbike" of the Late 70's.
          Back in the day this was the fastest  thing on the road, WITH DRUM BRAKES!!!!
          <br>
          Equiped with a 6 cylinder DOHC 1000cc Engine, which produced about 105 horsepower @9000 RPM, which was really impressive numbers for the 1970's
          This motorcycle with the exception of it's majestic engine was as conventional as motorcycles of the 70's where sporting telescopic forks,a Typical tube frame(oldschool)
          and twin rear shocks just how god intended, JK.
          <br>
          As many Zoomers would say this motorcycle is T H I C C, with that engine.
          <br>
          This engine Sound ver good(duh it's ahigh revving motorcycle with 6 cylinders ofc it will sound good)
          <br>
          So Let's Take a listen to it's Roar!
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        So as you can see this engine sounds like a mini F1 car, and certainly much much better than modern f1 cars!

    <h3>So what makes this bike BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>Old school motorcycle that is also THICCC</h5>
            <h5>>Sound of a mini F1 car beneath your crotch</h5>
            <h5>>6 Carbs!!! imagine the hell of tuning them!<h5>
            <h5>>Pretty /comfy/ bike<h5>
            </div>
        </div>
                <br>
    <h3>So why not give this bike a go??</h3>
    <p>Old and hard to find</p>
    <p>Dangerous because of Drums and old school suspension and lack of any rider Aids.</p>
