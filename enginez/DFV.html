          The Ford Cosworth DF-V, the most dominant engine ever in formula 1 an i would go as far as to say in motorsports as a whole.
          it is a 90Â° 3L V8, with an oversquared piston design.
          this engine was Originally designed in 1967 for the Lotus Team but was found in many other teams other than lotus.
          It was a big middle finger to ferrari from ford which at the time was also giving them the same treatment in the 24h of Le mans racing.
          <br>
          The engine features DOHC which was driven by internal gearing and featured ITB's (typical for this style of engine).
          the first version found in the lotus 49 produced over 400hp @ 9500RPM and later variants revved up to 11000 RPM and produced upwards of 520 hp!
          Truly a high revving engine.
