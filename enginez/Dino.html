          The Dino Platform was a modular engine design that allowed for V6 and V8 variants to be made.
          This engine family was found just about everywhere during from the 50's up until the very Early 2000's!!
          It was found in everything from ferrari sports cars , to rally cars even in formula 1 Cars during the 60's!!!!, this engine
          truly was King until it was killed by the DF-V in racing.
          <br>
          The most notable configurations were the 60° and 65° V6, the multitude of V8's and the 65° V12 found in the ferrari 456GT.
          The notable features were DOHC, IN THE 50's!!!
          The oversquared piston design(meaning more bore than stroke)
          and its low weight especially in the 60's
          <br>
