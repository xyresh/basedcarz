    <h2>The Jaguar XJ-R / XJ-8</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="img/jag.jpg" width="533" height="353">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Departing from the usual characteristics in the cars we discuss</p>
    <p>the Jaguar XJ-R is a classy elegant and menacing Car to drive.</p>
    <p>Being quite heavy we can clearly tell this car isn't meant to be driven aggressively.</p>
    <p>This is mostly the case as it's suspension has been designed with comfort in mind.</p>
    <p>The gearbox is an automatic and the power comes surprisingly by an obnoxious supercharged 4L V8</p>
    <p>So it is apparent this car has no reason to be on here.But it actually is.<p>
    <p>Being a spiritual successor to the jags of the past it maintains the exact same characteristics that made it </p>
    <p>popular amongst high level criminals ,being spacious, comfortable, menacing and elegant looks, and plenty of power to outrun the Authorities.</p>
    <p>and it can be driven rather aggressively if that is something required.</p>
    <p>Jaguar continued making similar models up untill last year 2019 with a v8 but greta killed them.</p>
    <p>and not that you'd be interested in them as they are jam packed with useless gadgets.</p>
    <p>the model we are looking at is the sweet spot ,as emphasis was given to build quality, and the interior is gorgeous with the wooden trim.</p>
    <br>   
    <br>
    <p>so as you can see we have analysed this car with completely different criteria and for good reason.</p>
    <p>it is however a car deserving a place on here and many more jaguar cars too.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>>the great interior and looks</h5>
    <h5>>That supercharged V8</h5>
    <h5>>The comfortable suspension that does not mean bad handling</h5>
    <h5>>the descent reliability as a result from an understressed large engine</h5>
    <h5>>and it's cheap price nowadays thanks to depriciation</h5>
    <h5>>The fact you will be quite unique when driving it on the road nowadays.<h5>
    <br>
    <h3>So why not give this car a go??</h3>
    <p>it may need some servicing to be done and it may be bit tricky to do</p>
    <p>it's not a sports car, it's not a GT car it is a thing of it's own and you will have to adapt to that</p>
    <p>some newer models may come with crappy electronics</p>
