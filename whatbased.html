    <h3 style="text-align: center;">What makes a car based according to me?</h3>
    <h5>A Car can be constituted BASED if it follows in general by the following ideals for me</h2>

    <br>
    <h5>>it's Leightweight</h5>
    <h5>>it hasn't got an emphasis on Power and Torque</h5>
    <h5>>A emphasis on the DRIVING EXPERIENCE meaning the car is nice to drive</h5>
    <h5>>Lacks Fancy gadgets and trivial things such as driver aids, extra unecessary comforts</h5>
    <h5>>is well balanced with good weight distribution</h5>
    <h5>>is well engineered not OVERengineered</h5>
    <h5>>has a responsive , linear and High revving engine that SOUNDS GOOD!</h5>
    <h5>>is reasonable to own and run(allthough this is not a requirement as many exotics also are considered BASED)</h5>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Unfortunately the car market has been invaded by SOY-gineers.</p>
        <p>these people have distorted the clear meaning of the sports car</p>
        <p>nowadays "sports cars" weigh 4000lbs and produce 500 hp out of extremely </p>
        <p>unresponsive "efficient" turbo engines with a billion computers and sensors</p>
        <p>they are filled to the brim with crappy gadgets like "InFoTaInMeNt SyStEmS and etc."</p>
        <p>and it is time we go against these trends and regain the sports car we love</p>
