    <h3 style="text-align: center;">What makes a car based according to me?</h3>
    <h5>A Car can be constituted BASED if it follows in general by the following ideals for me</h2>

    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <h5>>it's Leightweight</h5>
            <h5>>it hasn't got an emphasis on Power and Torque</h5>
            <h5>>A emphasis on the DRIVING EXPERIENCE meaning the car is nice to drive</h5>
            <h5>>Lacks Fancy gadgets and trivial things such as driver aids, extra unecessary comforts</h5>
            <h5>>is well balanced with good weight distribution</h5>
            <h5>>is WELL engineered not OVERengineered</h5>
            <h5>>has a responsive , linear and High revving engine that SOUNDS GOOD!</h5>
            <h5>>is reasonable to own and run(allthough this is not a requirement as many exotics also are considered BASED)</h5>
        </div>
    </div>

            <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 600px; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
            Unfortunately the car market has been invaded by SOY-gineers.

            these people have distorted the clear meaning of the sports car

            nowadays "sports cars" weigh 4000lbs and produce 500 hp out of extremely

            unresponsive "efficient" turbo engines with a billion computers and sensors

            they are filled to the brim with crappy gadgets like "InFoTaInMeNt SyStEmS and etc."

            and it is time we go against these trends and regain the sports car we love
