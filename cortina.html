    <br>
    <p>The Ford Cortina has a very Similar story to that of the Escort.It was an economy car built in Ford's UK factories</p>
    <p>Designed to be manufactured quickly and cheaply but it needed more marketing if it were to succeed. So the answer was<p>
    <p>a collaboration between Ford and british Sports and racecar manufacturer Lotus.The result was the lotus cortina.</p>
    <p>with some Work on the engine being done by Cosworth engineer Keith Duckworth making th engine a twincam 1300cc that produced about 105 hp</p>
    <p>with  major chassis changes being made to it by Lotus and sharing many parts with the Lotus Elan this car was a rocketship(for the time).</p>
    <p>being the most succesfull BTCC car in that Era and winning many Rallies.</p>
    <p>This car was essentially the beginning of the golden Era of ford which lasted up till the late 90's of cheap Performance Cars For the people.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>So what makes this car BASED??</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>>lightness with the weight being around 900kg's</h5>
    <h5>>Simplistic Design and lack of luxuries like AC and etc.</h5>
    <h5>>very good chassis as a result of Work being done By Lotus</h5>
    <h5>>Carbed engine....</h5>
    <h5>>Racing Heritage</h5>
    <br>
    <h3>So why not give the Cortina a go??</h3>
    <p>Hard to find any example</p>
    <p>Will require lot's of Restoration Work</p>
