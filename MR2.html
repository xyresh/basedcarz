    <p>Mounted Transversally Behind the driver it is a RWD mid engined Car. Quite unusual for a cheap Sport's car</p>
    <p>This allowed it to be used alot for Replicas and Fakes of Supercars.<p>
    <p>also it gained the nickname as a DeathTrap... which for the Early models was kind of justified due to</p>
    <p>The Lack of basic Safety features and often was in the hands of inexperienced reckless and incompetent drivers.<p>
    <p>which Explains the high crash Rate of it. nonetheless this car is the Supercar Formula at a lower price with less power.<p>
    <P>So it really has alot of potential regardless...</P>
